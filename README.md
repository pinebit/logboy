# smart-contract-monitor

Microservice monitoring Smart Contracts on-chain.

## Why?

Every smart-contract developer wants to monitor events related the contract.
A simple way to do that is just checking Etherscan and this can be sufficient for pet projects.
However, advanced projects require more sophisticated monitoring:

- monitoring in near real-time,
- leveraging powerful visualization tools like Grafana,
- setting up custom alerts, and many more.

This tool is designed for advanced monitoring, yet providing as simple as possible user experience.

## Usage

TBD
